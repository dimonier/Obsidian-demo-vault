*What you don‚Äôt want to lose is the underlying organizational philosophy of PARA, which I‚Äôve interpreted as:*

- Active projects should have their relevant information and tasks in one place.
- Projects should be contained within Areas when possible.
- Areas, too, should have all their relevant information in one place.
- Separate your active information (Projects & Areas) and inactive (Resources).
- Archive anything inactive, or no longer interesting.
