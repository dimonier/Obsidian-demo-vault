### Lesson 0: Мои находки в LYT kit

- [x] [[What is a note]] ✅ 2022-10-16

### Lesson 1: [Why should I link notes?](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-kit-course/lesson-1-introducing-linked-notes)
- [x]   Take a look around the LYT Kit and see where I’ve linked notes. Some are uplinks at the top of pages to help navigate. Others are types of indexes or maps covering specific topics. Perhaps one of the most important ways, notice how many linked notes fluidly and effortlessly connect ideas within actual paragraphs of other notes.
- [x]   Now take a look around your own vault. **How are you using linked notes?**
- [x]   **How would you like to improve this within your PKM setup?**
- [x]   Create a few additional links to notes within your vault where appropriate. Don’t go overboard, but try to link where it seems useful.

### Lesson 2: [Make notes for life using living notes](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-kit-course/lesson-2-make-notes-for-life-using-living-notes)

- [x]  Explore the [[Evergreen notes]] note, [[Note-takers]] and [[Note-makers]] notes
- [x] Read the related linked notes from the [[LYT kit]] note. ✅ 2022-10-16
- [x]   Take a look at some of your own notes. **Were you note-taking or note-making?** Try to identify a few notes in your vault that you’d like to further develop over time.
- [x]   You don’t need to start on them all today, but consider briefly adding your unique perspective to one of the notes in front of you now either in the LYT Kit or in your own vault. It can be just a sentence or two but it’ll hopefully start you on the path to note-making.

### Lesson 3: [Never lose your notes again with maps of content](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-kit-course/lesson-3-never-lose-your-notes-again-with-maps-of-content) 

- [ ] Read the [[Mental Squeeze Point]] and the [[MOCs are both workbenches and maps]] notes.
- [x] Continue exploring the MOCs in the Atlas MOC folder. Feel free to take some inspiration from any designs or go beyond them for your specific needs. ✅ 2022-10-17
- [x] Do you use MOCs in your vault? ✅ 2022-10-17
	- [x] Are you gathering notes? ✅ 2022-10-17
	- [ ] Are you developing notes?
	- [ ] Can you navigate to your notes?
	- [ ] Where could you be using your MOCs further?
- [ ] #green Create a new MOC somewhere in the LYT Kit or your own PKM system. It can be very basic to start - MOCs are built to evolve over time just as the notes they link to do.
- [x] Переиспользовать MOC из LYT kit ✅ 2022-10-17

### Lesson 4: [Launch yourself anywhere from your Home Note](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-kit-course/lesson-4-launch-yourself-anywhere-from-your-home-note)
- [ ]  Do you already have a Home Note in your vault? How is it similar? How is it different? Is there anything you’d like to change?
- [x] If you don’t have a Home Note already, create one. It doesn’t have to look identical, make it useful for _you._ ✅ 2022-10-17

### Lesson 5: [Get ACCESS to your thoughts and ideas](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-kit-course/lesson-5-get-access-to-your-thoughts-and-ideas)

- [x] Explore each folder within ACCESS. See where I’ve sorted certain types of notes and imagine where some of your own notes would go. ✅ 2022-10-17
- [x] Sometimes a note could potentially be placed in two different locations - try to trust your intuition, pick one folder, and know that it can always be found later using links and MOCs - that’s the beauty of this hybrid approach. ✅ 2022-10-17
- [ ] You can replicate some or all of this folder structure in your own PKM system in the future but it might be best to practice using ACCESS within the LYT Kit 6 vault at first to make sure it resonates with you before making large structural changes to your personal vault. Be sure to ask yourself, “What’s the appropriate amount of structure for me?”

### Lesson 6: [Manage your projects more easily with spaces](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-kit-course/lesson-6-manage-your-projects-more-easily-with-spaces)

Take a small project from your life and deploy MAPS for it in the LYT Kit 6 vault Spaces folder. It doesn’t need to be a very big one or one that’s very important, just a project you can practice working in and get comfortable with the framework.
Do you already handle projects at all in your current PKM system? Take a look at the differences between what you’re currently doing and what could be done in your own Spaces folder. Are there any obvious pros or cons to either workflow?
Just remember, it’s personal knowledge management so if your old system works, don’t feel pressured to change it. We all process information differently.
